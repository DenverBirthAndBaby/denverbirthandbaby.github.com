		<p>Oh my, diapering appears complicated when looking at all the options parents have these days. However, as in past years there are still only two choices, cloth or disposable. Disposables fill up landfills, make for a disgusting stench in the home trash, but offer no fuss convenience. Cloth diapers are nothing like even a decade ago, they have evolved to fashion and convenience without the landfill and tree ecological concerns. Initially cloth diapers are a big upfront cost, but one must remember that they will be used for many months. There is also the local diaper service, cloth, ecology and convenience.</p>
<p>Cloth diapers appear on the market in many different fabrics from bamboo, wool, and hemp, but the standard cotton is still popular. Hemp, bamboo and wool are more expensive than cotton, and provide a bit more waterproofing. Watch out however, the designer fabrics are not all that eco-friendly in the manufacturing process and quite expensive.</p>
<p>Cloth diapering simply means an absorbent material (the diaper) and a cover to prevent spillage to clothing. Diapers come in flat fold, pre-fold, pocket diapers, and the fitted and contoured all-in-one. For the money, a cotton pre-fold and cover with velcro or snap closures is the simplest and least expensive. All-in-one diapers have both the diaper and cover together , but many moms say it takes a long time to dry them , you must have a good supply available of these expensive all-in-one diapers. Rememer babies initially for the first several months use about twelve diapers per day.</p>
<p>It is best to find a local store with these products so you can see what you get, but that can be difficult in some cities. Internet shopping is another option.</p>
<p>Listed below are my favorite local stores and internet sites packed with information and products.</p>

		<p>Parents begin parenthood concerned about a baby&#8217;s sleep patterns and &#8220;sleeping through the night. Mothers of newborns need to guard against their own sleep deprivation by resting when baby is resting for at least the first 6 weeks. Keeping visitors at bay will also help, and anyone who has ever had a newborn will understand your need for rest, sleep, and privacy in the first few weeks. This also aids in baby patterning its sleep and feeding patterns. Excessive handling of an infant and unscheduled visitors will only bring disharmony to nature&#8217;s way of the new family getting off to a good start.</p>
<p>Babies are usually able to sleep through the night after three to four months of age. At this time they may sleep for six to eight hours at a time. However, some babies will not have a long sleep period until they are nine months to one year old.</p>
<p>Sleeping through the night does not have anything to do with the size of the baby, it is all about the individual infant sleep maturity of the infant. Feeding solids earlier than four months has no evidence research to back this practice up and does not have anything to do with an infant sleeping longer periods of time. Parents who give solids early risk introducing allergies and choking hazards. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no solids until four to six months depending on health needs determined by the health care provider and exclusive breastfeeding until this time.</p>

		<p><strong>Crying is a form of communication for baby</strong> and parent. Your baby cries differently for different needs. It takes awhile for parents to learn what their baby is telling them with a cry.</p>
<p>Frequent causes of crying :</p>
<p><strong>Hunge</strong>r, especially if it has been over two hours and baby is breastfeeding</p>
<p><strong>D</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>scomfort</strong> such as a wet or soiled diaper, too tight clothing, feeling hot or cold</p>
<p>A form of <strong>tension</strong> release</p>
<p>A need for a change in <strong>position</strong></p>
<p><strong>Over stimulation or activity</strong></p>
<p><strong>Illness</strong></p>
<p>Babies develop a <strong>sense of trust</strong> that you will be there when she or he cries if you respond to <strong>ALL</strong> crying. This sense of trust will be a necessary foundation in his or her development. If crying causes you stress always find someone who can help you comfort baby and give yourself a reprieve from the crying. Babies cry because they have a need. Remember babies are not crying to aggravate you. Crying should always be met with care and comfort. Breast fed infants usually cry less because mother is part of the comfort and relief for most of the cause of discomfort just by offering the breast. Breast fed infants can not be overfed. No infant can be held too much, contrary to the wives tale that you can spoil your infant by holding them to much. Remember your infant will not want to be held forever, treasure this wonderful time now.</p>

		<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends infants be placed to sleep on their back. Since the start of this campaign in 1992, there has been a 40% decrease in sudden infant death. Most SIDS occurs in the first four months of life, but the risk continues for a year.</p>
<p>There is a low incidence of SID in the first four weeks after birth. Overheating, smoking increase the incidence of SID. Fifteen babies die per day of this syndrome, which is still not fully understood by the medical profession.</p>
<p>Breastfeeding is known to lower the incidence of SIDS. This is probably due to the fact that the infant is in a less deep sleep state when breastfeeding during the night sleep.</p>
<p>An independent researcher examined the U.S. Consumer Safety Product Commission data from 1999-2001 and concluded that sleeping with your baby is actually safer than not sleeping with your baby. This data was published in the Mothering Magazine Sept/Oct 2002.</p>
<p>If you do choose to sleep with your baby remember to allow baby to be adjacent to mother, as fathers in the first few months are not as aware of the infant in bed, but they do develop this sense as baby sleeps with both parents.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t allow children to sleep with a baby under nine months of age.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t allow others to sleep with baby, they do not have the keen sense of baby awareness during sleep.</p>
<p>Use no fluffy bedding, waterbeds, or featherbeds that can potentially trap baby and inhibit breathing.</p>
<p>An alternative to sharing your bed is a co-sleeper.</p>
<p>Never use drugs, alcohol when sleeping with baby.</p>
<p>Parent sleepwear or jewelry must not possess ties or strings longer than eight inches.</p>
<p>Strong perfume and scents can irritate and clog baby&#8217;s delicate air passages during sleep.</p>
<p>Read Dr. William Sears website about SIDS and co-sleeping. <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com" title="www.askdrsears.com">www.askdrsears.com</a></p>
<p>Best practices to prevent SIDS are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a firm mattress for baby to sleep upon</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Never place an infant on their side or stomach to sleep.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Never use waterbeds, sheepskins, loose bedding, stuffed animals, comforters, pillows, quilts, sleep positioners, or bumper pads around a sleeping baby.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Never place an infant on a sofa or chair to sleep. Don&#8217;t fall asleep with baby on a couch. Baby may get wedged between the back of the couch and the larger person&#8217;s body, or baby&#8217;s head may become buried in cushion crevices or soft cushions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests using a pacifier when placing baby to sleep on its back. This does not apply to the first month of an infant&#8217;s life if the infant is breastfeeding.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Research does not show home sleep monitors to be effective in preventing SIDS in the normal newborn.</li>
</ul>

<p>This photo is a perfect latch 30 minutes after delivery. Mother required assistance with the latch, but the baby suckled instinctively.</p>
<p>Latch is the buzz word new breastfeeding mothers keep hearing about in the early days and weeks of feeding their newborn infants. Latch is simply the way the infant attaches to the mother&#8217;s breast to suckle the milk. Infants are born with the innate ability to suckle correctly. New mother&#8217;s,on the other hand, must acquire the skill and learn how to allow the infant to attach correctly to their breasts.</p>
<p>New mothers throughout history have learned this latching skill from watching their own mothers and other women attach their infants and breastfeed. Observation from childhood until adulthood with maternal support after the birth of a child gave women optimal ability to perform latch correctly. Today, latching an infant with little more than an hour or two class, video presentation and then practicing for the first time on their own newborn infants presents a distinct disadvantage. I believe it is the cause of much of the breastfeeding failure in the first six weeks.</p>
<p>I suggest the following for latch and breastfeeding success for the new mother.</p>
<p>l. Deliver at a hospital where there is a lactation consultant who will help with latch and breastfeeding before discharge for every newly delivered mother. Usually, at a home delivery, the midwife will provide initial support. Be prepared to seek other support for breastfeeding after delivery day.</p>
<p>2 Attend a prenatal breastfeeding class with your partner.</p>
<p>3. Attend a La Leche League meeting prenatally. You will get to watch latching and breastfeeding from experience mothers.</p>
<p>4. Choose a pediatrician who has breastfed or who has a spouse who has breastfed.</p>
<p>5. Before baby is born locate a lactation consultant who is available should you need assistance. Know the rate for their service and whether they make home visits.</p>

		<p>August 1 through August 7, was World Breastfeeding Week 2008.</p>
<p>In the United States, the percentage of infants ever breastfed increased from 60% of those born in 1993-94 to 74% of those born in 2005. However, there is much to be done on the part of America in promoting breastfeeding in favor of formula feeding. Some of the work to be done to improve breastfeeding promotion needs to begin at the hospital. Routine distribution of formula by hospital staff to new parents at discharge through a &#8220;gift diaper bag&#8221; containing formula is freely given to most mothers in US hospitals. This sends a subtle message that formula is acceptable nourishment for their infant without disclosing formula dangers and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Scientific evidence clearly demonstrates that breastfed infants have a lower incidence and severity of infections than formula-fed infants: less severe diarrhea, respiratory, and ear infections. Evidence additionally shows a lack of breastfeeding is associated with increased risk of leukemia, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and deaths associated with sudden infant death syndrome.</p>
